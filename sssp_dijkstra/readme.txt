(1) ./run.sh will compile the 3 programs 
(2) Serial and openMP will be timed and validated on inputs of 8 graphs
(3) Times of each run will be saved un Times.txt and their validation check on size 8 will be displayed in results
(4) inputs have been validated manually but an example is displayed in results.txt
(5) I was unable to dynamically increment MPI as i did with Serial and openMP thus it is manually adjusted, running ./run.sh will
    only graph 7. however all increments were timed and validated for the report manually
